# Magnus Carls-Bot
A good starting point for a simple terminal based design! Would look little ugly, but that is okay.

# Usage
Either through Jupyter Notebooks for a clean UI which will play against you (smartly, at that!), or through CLI Terminal-based wherein you call a move as follows:
"Pawn move from A2 to A4" would translate to "a2a4" on the CLI
