# Magnus Carls-Bot
A 5 levels deep, minimax algorithm playing chessbot, that seems smart (better than me at chess, but I doubt that is saying much!)

# Usage
Run chessScript.py either through Jupyter Notebooks Platform for a clean UI which will play against you (smartly, at that!), or through CLI Terminal-based wherein you call a move as follows:
"Pawn move from A2 to A4" would translate to "a2a4" on the CLI
